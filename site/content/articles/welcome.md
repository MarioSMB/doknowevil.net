Summary: A blog about technology, programming, systems, and efficiency

This is my new blog, using [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), with a custom theme I created based on [pelican-materialize-blog](https://github.com/z/doknowevil.net/tree/master/site/themes/pelican-materialize-blog).  I wanted to move away from [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org), or any dynamic CMS for the blog format.  [Statically generated sites](https://www.staticgen.com/) are a safer, less demanding method for publishing.  I chose Pelican primarily because it was a Python-based static site generator I've seen used succesfully.
